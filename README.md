# topcoffea
Top quark analyses using the Coffea framework

This is a developing effort... no complete instructions or test yet!

### Contents
- analysis
   Subfolders with different analyses: creating histograms, applying selections...
   Also including plotter scripts and/or jupyter files

- cfg
  Configuration files (lists of samples, cross sections...)

- data
  External inputs used in the analysis: scale factors, corrections...

- modules
  Auxiliar python modules and scripts

- plotter
  Tools to produce stack plots and other plots

### Set up the environment 
- Activate a conda environment. 
- Install coffea (0.6.39) and xrootd

### How to start
- This directory is set up to be installed as a python package. To install, run `pip install -e .` from the top level directory. The `-e` option installs the project in editable mode (i.e. setuptools "develop mode"). If you wish to uninstall the package, you can do so by running `pip uninstall topcoffea`.
- Set up the cfg file you want to use, and run `python moca/samples.py cfg/your_cfg.cfg`. This produces a coffea file (`coffeaFiles/samples.coffea`).
- Run `analysis/topEFT/run.py`.
